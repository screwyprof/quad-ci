# Quad CI

[![ci](https://github.com/screwyprof/quad-ci/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/screwyprof/quad-ci/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Quad CI is a _simple_, _tiny_ and _beginner friendly_ Continuous Integration system written in Haskell.

This is a purely educational project I've done to learn Haskell. It was done by following [Simple Haskell Book](https://marcosampellegrini.com/simple-haskell-book).  
All the credits and kudos go to **Marco Sampellegrini**.

The original project is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/alpacaaa/quad-ci).

### Features

- sandboxed builds in docker containers
- multi-node architecture with agents picking up jobs to work on
- http api to interact with the frontend and other nodes
- support for triggering builds with github webhooks
